# MeTube

Basically tryna make my own YouTube clone. The main idea was to make an asynchronous video encoding system on backend after uploading raw file on web, 
then storing it in a CDN for consumption.

But that was like YouTube, so I decided to make the whole thing be a vid upload site cuz why tf not?


Work in progress, don't even know when I'ma finish it tbh.
