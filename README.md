# MeTube
A backend system inspired by YouTubeâ€™s upload flow. It allows users to upload videos (chunked) through a REST API, which are then processed by distributed encoder workers. The video encoding process involves generating multiple video qualities using FFMPEG, with storage handled by S3/MinIO and message dispatching done via RabbitMQ.

## Requirements
1. Python (for REST API)
2. C++ (for encoder worker code)
3. FFMPEG (video encoding)
4. RabbitMQ (task distribution)
5. S3/MinIO (for video storage)
6. Docker (for containerization)
7. PostgreSQL (for storing video information)
8. React (for the web frontend)
